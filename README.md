#### [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) is a project to organize world's knowledge, explore connections and curate learning paths.

**New Design**

Mockups for the next version of Learn Anything. There will be a "Learn" section focused on study plans created and improved by users, and an "Explore" section for discovering the topics in a mind map.
